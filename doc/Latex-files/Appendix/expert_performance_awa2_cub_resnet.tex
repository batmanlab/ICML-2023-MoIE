\textbf{(a-b)} Coverage and proportional accuracy of the experts and residuals. 
\textbf{(c-d)} We route the samples covered by the residuals across iterations to the initial Blackbox $f^0$ and compare the accuracy of $f^0$ (red bar) with the residual (blue bar).}

\cref{fig:expert_performance_cv_resnet} shows the coverage (top row), performances (bottom row) of each expert and residual across iterations of - (a) ResNet101-derived Awa2 and (b) ResNet101-derived CUB-200 respectively.
