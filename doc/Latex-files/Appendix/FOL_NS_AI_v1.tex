FOL is a logical function
that accepts predicates (concept presence/absent) as input and returns a True/False output being a
logical expression of the predicates. The logical expression, which is a set of AND, OR, Negative,
and parenthesis, can be written in the so-called Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF)~\cite{mendelson2009introduction}. DNF is a FOL logical formula composed of a disjunction (OR) of conjunctions (AND), known as the ``sum of products''. 

Neuro-symbolic AI is an area of study that encompasses deep neural
networks with symbolic approaches to computing and AI to complement
the strengths and weaknesses of each, resulting in a robust AI capable
of reasoning and cognitive modeling~\cite{belle2020symbolic}.
Neuro-symbolic systems are hybrid models that leverage the robustness
of connectionist methods and the soundness of symbolic reasoning to
effectively integrate learning and reasoning
\cite{garcez2015neural,besold2017neural}.
